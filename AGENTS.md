## Rules
- Before committing code, tell the user what you are about to change exactly and ask for permission. 
- Tell the user what consequences the change will have--what was the existing/previous behavior or style setting and what will it be after the change. Tell them the current line numbers of the change/s so they can go and inspect
- Do not commit the code change without approval unless the user provides explicit "ok to make all changes" in the prompt you receive
- Do not update the project readme without being explicitly instructed to do so

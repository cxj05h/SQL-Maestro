- If a user asks to make a change to a code that seems risky, recommend a "feature flag" 
- If a user doesn't use the correct language to describe what changes they want to make in the UI, or how they want something to function, provide them the right words they're looking for, or suggest the right "syntax language" so the user and the Agent can be on the same page--if there is ambiguity, this needs to be sorted out first between the two
